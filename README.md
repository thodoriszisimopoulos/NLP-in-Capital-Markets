# NLP in Capital Markets

This project utilizes NLP to enhance Debt Capital Markets by transforming unstructured financial data into structured insights, aiming to improve operational efficiency and decision-making in financial services.

This project aims to leverage AI techniques to enhance financial capital markets, focusing on Debt Capital Markets (DCM). DCM represents a $6 trillion sector vital for the global economy, facilitating the financing needs of corporations and governments. This initiative seeks to modernize DCM, addressing its challenges and harnessing opportunities through advanced technology.

Despite DCM's significance, where banks earn over $24 billion in fees annually, technology integration has lagged behind industry needs. Increasing operational costs, decreasing issuance fees, and a stringent regulatory framework have prompted a renewed focus on technology solutions. This project will concentrate on aggregating and sanitizing data to provide analytics that improve efficiency, reduce effort, and enhance business attraction for global investment banks.

At the core of this initiative are AI techniques aimed at transforming how data is utilized in the banking sector. The project will deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP) to:
1. Convert unstructured financial data into structured formats, incorporating sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
2. Execute complex queries on historical and real-time transactional data to provide actionable insights.

This effort is designed to deliver tangible commercial results within a specified timeframe.
